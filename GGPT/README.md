Official PyTorch implementation of **Geometry-grounded Point Transformer (GGPT)** (CVPR 2026). GGPT is a method for high-quality 3D reconstruction from multiview images. For more details, please visit our [project webpage](https://chenyutongthu.github.io/research/ggpt).

## 🛠️ 1. Installation

### 1.1 Clone the repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chenyutongthu/GGPT.git
cd GGPT
```


### 1.2 Install dependencies

#### a. Create a virtual environment.
#### b. Install torch, torchvision for your CUDA version. (The environment does not require specific CUDA or pytorch version. It has been tested in CUDA 12.1/12.3 and torch 2.2.0/2.5.1.)

#### c. Install requirements for VGGT and SfM.
```
pip install -r requirements_sfm.txt
# Choose which matcher to use.
# For RoMaV2
cd RoMaV2/ && pip install -e .
# For RoMaV1
pip install fused-local-corr>=0.2.2
cd RoMa/ && pip install -e .
```

#### d. \[Optional\] If you need to run GGPT, the 3D point transformer, please follow [the script](ptv3_env.sh) install the following packages in the same virtual environement. You don't need to build another env for this.

#### e. Download our pretrained GGPT checkpoint directly [here](https://huggingface.co/YutongGoose/GGPT) and place it in [ckpts/].

## 2. 📖 Usage & Examples


```bash

python run_demo.py image_dir=/path/to/your/images

```

The outputs (including the feedforward points, SfM points, and the final GGPT points `ggpt_points.ply`) will be saved in the `outputs/demo/` directory by default.


Or you can add ```common_config.ggpt_refine=False``` disable GGPT refinement and run SfM to only obtain the sparse reconstruction.


### ⚙️ Configuration Settings (SfM)

You can adjust Structure-from-Motion (SfM) configuration blocks in the `.yaml` files (found under `configs/`) to better suit your data. 

```yaml
ba_config:
  shared_camera: True # Set it to False if images are captured with different camera intrinsics
  camera_type: SIMPLE_PINHOLE # Set it to PINHOLE if the images can have very different fx and fy.

dlt_config:
  # Adjust the filtering parameters if you need more accurate yet sparser SfM points. E.g.:
  score_thresh: 0.1       # Increase the matching confidence threshold to filter out noisy matchings
  cycle_err_thresh: 4     # Reduce the cycle error threshold to filter out noisy tracks
  max_epipolar_error: 4   # Reduce the epipolar error threshold to filter out noisy tracks
  min_tri_angle: 3        # Increase the triangulation angle threshold to filter out points with low parallax
  max_reproj_error: 4     # Reduce the reprojection error threshold to filter out noisy points
```


### 🎬 Large number of input views

When working with a large number of input views (e.g., > 50), use the following configuration to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors. Additionally, for denser view sets, we recommend applying stricter filtering thresholds during the SfM process. 

```
python run_demo.py \
    common_config.reduce_memory=True match_config.models=romav2-fast \
    ba_config.score_thresh=0.8 ba_config.cycle_err_thresh=1 ba_config.mintrack_per_view=512 \
    dlt_config.cycle_err_thresh=1 dlt_config.max_reproj_error=1 dlt_config.min_tri_angle=7 \
    hydra.run.dir=outputs/demo/ image_dir=/path
```

Note on Scalability: The current pipeline performs exhaustive matching, which leads to longer runtimes for large-scale or dense view reconstructions. For better efficiency in these scenarios, we recommend integrating sparse graph building.

### Trouble shooting.

* If you run into this issue when running RoMaV2 `raise RuntimeError("Float32 matmul precision must be set to highest")`,  manually add `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision("highest")` before the warning line.

* If you run into this issue when running DLT triangulation `torch._C._LinAlgError: cusolver error: CUSOLVER_STATUS_INVALID_VALUE`, reduce `dlt_config.batch_size` to a smaller value, e.g. 50000. This is [a torch-version-specific issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/166004).

## 3. 📊 Evaluation


### 3.1 Evaluation on our benchmark

Download the [preprocessed evaluation set](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YutongGoose/GGPT_eval) and place it at the root of this project as `GGPT_eval`. Run `sh benchmark_eval.sh`

### 3.2 Evaluation on your custom data

You can evaluate GGPT on your own datasets by organizing your data into a `custom_eval_set` or by modifying the dataloader.

**a. Organize your data directory**

Prepare your dataset following this directory structure:

```text
custom_eval_set/
└── seq0/
    ├── depths/                  # Ground truth depth maps
    │   ├── 000000.npy           # (H, W) float32 array
    │   └── ...
    ├── images/                  # Input images
    │   ├── 000000.jpg           # (H, W, 3) RGB image
    │   └── ... 
    ├── extrinsics.npy           # (N, 4, 4) world-to-camera matrices (OpenCV convention)
    └── intrinsics.npy           # (N, 3, 3) linear camera intrinsics (top-left pixel center is (0,0))
```

**b. Update dataset configurations**

Add your custom dataset configuration to the evaluation YAML file (e.g., `configs/benchmark_sfm.yaml`):

```yaml
valdataset_configs:
  - _target_: sfm.dataloader.extracted.ExtractedDataset
    name: custom_eval_set
    root: PATH/TO/custom_eval_set
```

**c. Run the evaluation**

First, run the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipeline to extract the sparse point clouds:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 --rdzv-endpoint=localhost:2026 \
    sfm/run_benchmark_sfm.py \
    match_config.models='romav2-base' \
    feedforward_config.model='vggt-point' \
    hydra.run.dir=outputs/custom_eval/sfm_vggt-point_romav2
```

Then, run the GGPT pipeline using the output from the SfM step:

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --nnodes=1 --nproc_per_node=1 \
    --rdzv-endpoint=localhost:2026 \
    ggpt/run_benchmark_ggpt.py \
    valdataset_configs.data_dict.custom_eval_set=outputs/custom_eval/sfm_vggt-point_romav2/save/custom_eval_set \
    hydra.run.dir=outputs/custom_eval/ggpt_vggt-point_romav2
```
## 💡 Limitations

While our work demonstrates that geometry optimization provides meaningful constraints that significantly improve feed-forward 3D reconstruction, our current method can still fail under specific conditions. For an in-depth discussion, please refer to the limitations section in our paper's appendix.

* **Ill-posed Geometry:**  extremely low overlap or parallax (distant tree in outdoor scenes), in-the-wild photos captured under significantly different lightings, ambiguous and misleading symmetric structures, and dynamic scenes.
* **GGPT Refinement:** GGPT currently faces challenges with long-range extrapolation in monocular regions and can occasionally produce patchify artifacts in large-scale scenes.

We invite you to share failure cases via GitHub Issues to help guide future research!
